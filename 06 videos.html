<strong>Don't Fear the Internet</strong><em>by Rus Maschmeyer,Strange Native</em>

    <li><a href= "http://vimeo.com/24006296">part 1</li></a>
    <li><a href= "http://vimeo.com/25665411">part 2</li></a>
    <li><a href= "http://vimeo.com/27833342">part 3</li></a>

    <li>The first part exlpained what the internet is.  The internet is billions of computers connected through wires that run all over the earth.  He explainedd the importance of servers and said that servers are the backbone of the web. A website is a collection of files stored on a server.  There is a static website which is just a folder with webpage files.</li>
    <li>He then discuseed browsers.  he used the example of vanilla icecream to explain browers; Vanilla icecream at different places are always look or taste different from eachother but in the end are very similar.  Browsers are also a little different from eachother but largely the same.</li>
    <li> you can right click to view the source code</li>
    <li>right click on image and inspect image to view css style code to that element</li> 
<li>He explained different kinds of style in html.
    One kind of style to html is Inline style-- add style rules directly, 1 by 1 
another kind is Internal CSS-- styles rules in head of the html using a style tag. add a single rule and have it apply to any/all element using one line of code.
    external CSS is the most effecient because you only have to update one file.</li>
<li>CSS and HTML are similar because html has fixed elecments css has fixed properties.
    CSS rule consists of selectors and declaration, every declaration ends with ";"</li>
    <li>I thought this video was interesting and also easy to follow.</li>

<strong>10 things I didnt know about HTML</strong>
        <em>Mathias Bynens</em>
        <li>  <a href="http://vimeo.com/89935203"></a></li>
    
    <li>I honestly was unable to follow what he was saying most of the time, and was pretty confused these are some of the notes I took though</li>
    <li> When it comes to HTML validation there are somethings computers can not validate, and is needed validation by a human.</li>
    <li>can omit closing tags and opening tags, because implied elements, therefore the tags are optional in the markup</li>
<li>if font family name is space seperated, there is no need to use quotes
    when in doubt, use "" and ";"</li>
    <li>charecters in JS are not always equal to string length</li>
    <li>JS variables-if variable is undefined it is false, if it is a number in most cases it will be true</li>

    <li>This video like the previous video was kind of hard for me to follow, I didn't really understand the main point behing it, here is a few things I got from it:</li>
    <li>10% of books were made just last year</li>
    <li>40 million instagram photos each year</li>
    <li>144 billion emails sent each day</li>
    <li>90% of data created in the last year</li>
    <li>today its so easy to create/generate things with the convenience of technology</li>
    <li>Craft vs. crap- craft-- things that are genuinly good will be shared</li>
    <li>humans now try to maximize signal and minimize noise</li>
    <li>respect your craft and other people's time</li>
    <li>be original</li>
    <li>He pretty much thinks everything is bullshit</li>ÃŸ
