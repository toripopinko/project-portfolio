<h2>Potager</h2>
<p>Plants are chosen as much for their functionality as for their color and form.
Many are trained to grow upward. A well-designed potager can provide food, cut
flowers and herbs for the home with very little maintenance. Potagers can disguise
their function of providing for a home in a wide array of forms - from the carefree
style of the cottage garden to the formality of a knot garden.</p>
<p>A potager is a French term for an ornamental vegetable or kitchen garden. Often flowers
(edible and non-edible) and herbs are planted with the vegetables to enhance the garden's beauty.
The goal is to make the function of providing food aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<h2>Cottage Garden</h2>
<p>The cottage garden is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design, dense plantings,
and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants.</p>
 
<p>The Cottage Garden originated in England and its history can be traced back for centuries, although
they were re-invented in 1870's England, when stylized versions were formed as a reaction to the more
structured and rigorously maintained English estate gardens.</p>
 
<p>The earliest< cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants, with an emphasis on
vegetables and herbs, along with some fruit trees.</p>
